going to be used to initialise repo and create first branch called webdev01.  this is our first ever ticket based around joezak12 making our website.
we will start to make the tickets more focused but for now the tickets will be generalised around getting the group up and running. i would like to implament trello at some point as i feel it would help organise our tickets a hell of a lot better.
